         CMake is re-running because C:/Users/Vincent/Documents/GitHub/DuelMaster/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
           the file 'C:/Users/Vincent/Documents/GitHub/DuelMaster/cmake_modules/FindSFML.cmake'
           is newer than 'C:/Users/Vincent/Documents/GitHub/DuelMaster/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'

         CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
           By not providing "FindSFML.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
           asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SFML", but
           CMake did not find one.
         
           Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SFML" (requested
           version 1) with any of the following names:
         
             SFMLConfig.cmake
             sfml-config.cmake
         
           Add the installation prefix of "SFML" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
           "SFML_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SFML"
           provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
           installed.
